excerpt: "My first linocut. A reduction print of an abstracted bass body."

My very first linocut print. Starting with the bass body, I printed the entire run. Once complete, I carved down to the neck, tailpiece, and f-holes. I then completed the series with the black. The entire series has been given away.
